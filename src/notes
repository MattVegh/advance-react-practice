React recursively renders components down one branch until there are no more to render.

Changes to state or props in any component will recursively re-render down the remaining tree
whether those components have changed or not. 

shouldComponentUpdate(), React.PureComponent, and React.memo() are tools to help this this problem.

shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
    Lifecycle method on class components
    Allows you to determine if a component should update or not
    Recieves the upcoming props and state so you can compare them against current props and state
    return true for "yes", false for "no"
    Don't do deep equality checks in shouldComponentUpdate()
